      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# inline_syscall [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/OS-windows-green.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/compiler-clang-green.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/arch-x64-green.svg)]()
Header only library that allows you to generate direct syscall instructions in an optimized, inlineable and easy to use manner.

## How to use
All you have to do is copy over the header files and call the initialization function `init_syscalls_list` before using the `INLINE_SYSCALL(function_pointer)` and `INLINE_SYSCALL_T(function_type)` macros.

```cpp
// This header contains the initialization function.
// If you already initialized, inline_syscall.hpp contains all you need.
#include "inline_syscall/include/in_memory_init.hpp"

// Needs to be called once at startup before INLINE_SYSCALL is used.
jm::init_syscalls_list();

// Usage of the main macro INLINE_SYSCALL
void* allocation = nullptr;
SIZE_T size      = 0x1000;
NTSTATUS status  = INLINE_SYSCALL(NtAllocateVirtualMemory)((HANDLE)-1, &allocation, 0, &size, MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);
```

## What code does it generate
As one of the main goals of this library is to be as optimized as possible here is the output of an optimized build.
```asm
mov qword ptr [rsp+30h], 0                  ; void* allocation = nullptr
mov qword ptr [rsp+28h], 1000h              ; SIZE_T size      = 0x1000;
mov eax, dword ptr [entry (07FF683157004h)] ; syscall id is loaded
lea rdx, [rsp+30h]                          ; BaseAddress     = &allocation
lea r9, [rsp+28h]                           ; RegionSize      = &size
mov r10, 0FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFh                 ; ProcessHandle   = -1
xor r8d,r8d                                 ; ZeroBits        = 0
sub rsp,40h                                 ; preparing stack
mov qword ptr [type],3000h                  ; AllocationType  = MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT
mov qword ptr [protect], 4                  ; Protect         = PAGE_READWRITE
syscall                                     ; syscall instruction itself
add rsp,40h                                 ; restoring stack
```

## FAQ
* Q: What are the main uses of this? A: Obfuscation and hook avoidance.
* Q: Why would I use this over some other library? A: The code this generates can be inlined and it is optimized for every single parameter count as much as possible.
* Q: Why can't this work on MSVC? A: MSVC doesn't support GCC style inline assembly which can be properly optimized and worked on by compiler.
* Q: Why can't this work on GCC? A: Contrary to MSVC, GCC is too good at optimizing inline assembly and as such breaks my code that tries to be somewhat generic.

## Creating your own initialization function
This library enables you to create your own custom initialization routines that are more resilent against missing syscalls or acquire syscall ids in some other way.

`JM_INLINE_SYSCALL_ENTRY_TYPE` can be defined with your own syscall entry type that needs to be constructible from a hash. By default `syscall_entry_small` is used, but `syscall_entry_full` is also shipped.

If you want to use the provided `INLINE_SYSCALL` macro you will need to use the provided `jm::hash` function.

To acquire the start of syscall entries you need to call `jm::syscall_entries()` and iterate untill you hit a zero entry.
