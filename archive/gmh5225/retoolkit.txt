      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Reverse Engineer's Toolkit

## What?

This is a collection of tools you may like if you are interested in reverse engineering and/or malware analysis on x86 and x64 Windows systems. After installing this program, you'll have two ways to access the tools:

* Double-click the `retoolkit` icon in the Desktop.
* Right-click on a file, choose `Send to -> retoolkit`. This way the selected file is passed as argument to the desired program.

![](assets/retoolkit.gif)

## Why do I need it?

You don't. Obviously, you can download such tools from their own website and install them by yourself in a new VM. But if you download retoolkit, it will probably save you some time. Additionally, the tools come pre-configured so you'll find things like x64dbg with a few plugins, command-line tools working from any directory, etc. You may like it if you're setting up a new analysis VM.

## Download

The *.iss files you see here are the source code for our setup program built with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php). To download the real thing, you have to go to the [Releases](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/releases) section and download the setup program.

## Included tools

Have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/wiki) for a detailed list.

## Is it safe to install it in my environment?

I don't know. Some included tools are not open source and come from shady places. You should use it exclusively in virtual machines and under your own responsibility.

## Can you add tool X?

It depends. The idea is to keep it simple. We won't add a tool just because it's not here yet. But if you think there's a good reason to do so, and the license allows us to redistribute the software, please [open an issue here](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/issues?q=label%3Atool-request+) if it doesn't exist yet.

# Boîte à outils du rétro-ingénieur

## Quoi ?

Il s'agit d'une collection d'outils qui pourraient vous intéresser si vous vous consacrez à la rétro-ingénierie et/ou à l'analyse des logiciels malveillants sur les systèmes Windows x86 et x64. Après avoir installé ce programme, vous devrez obtenir plusieurs moyens d'accéder aux outils :

* Double-clic sur l'icône `retoolkit` présent sur le Bureau.
* Clic droit sur un fichier, choisissez `Envoyer vers -> retoolkit`. De cette manière, le fichier sélectionné est transmis comme argument au programme souhaité.

![](assets/retoolkit.gif)

## Pourquoi en ai-je besoin ?

Ce n'est pas le cas. Évidemment, vous pouvez télécharger ces outils depuis leur propre site Web et les installer vous-même dans une nouvelle VM. Mais si vous téléchargez retoolkit, cela peut probablement vous faire gagner du temps. De plus, les outils sont livrés préconfigurés, vous trouverez donc des choses comme x64dbg avec quelques plugins, des outils en ligne de commande fonctionnant depuis n'importe quel répertoire, etc. Vous l'apprécierez sans doute si vous mettez en place une nouvelle VM d'analyse.

## Téléchargement

Les fichiers *.iss que vous voyez ici sont le code source de notre programme d'installation construit avec [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php). Pour télécharger le vrai programme, vous devez aller dans la section [Releases](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/releases) et télécharger le programme d'installation.

## Outils intégrés

Venez jeter un oeil au [wiki](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/wiki) pour obtenir une liste détaillée.

## Est-il sûr de l'installer dans mon environnement ?

Je ne sais pas. Certains outils inclus ne sont pas open source et proviennent d'endroits peu recommandables. Vous devez l'utiliser exclusivement dans des machines virtuelles et sous votre propre responsabilité.

## Pouvez-vous ajouter l'outil X ?

Cela dépend. L'idée est de rester simple. Nous n'ajouterons pas un outil simplement parce qu'il n'existe pas encore. Mais si vous pensez qu'il y a une bonne raison de le faire et que la licence nous permet de redistribuer le logiciel, veuillez [ouvrir une issue ici](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/issues?q=label%3Atool-request+) s'il n'existe pas encore.

# Tersine Mühendis'in Araç Takımı

## Nedir?

x86 ve x64 Windows sistemlerde tersine mühendislik ve/veya zararlı yazılım analizine meraklı olanların beğenebileceği bir araç koleksiyonudur. Bu programı indirdikten sonra araçlara erişmek için iki seçeneğiniz olacak:

* Masaüstündeki `retoolkit` simgesine çift tıklayın.
* Bir dosyaya sağ tıklayın, `Gönder -> retoolkit`'i seçin. Böylelikle seçilen dosya, istenen programa argüman olarak verilmiş olur.

![](assets/retoolkit.gif)

# Neden ihtiyacım var?

İhtiyacınız yok. Açıkçası, yeni bir sanal makine içerisine bu tür araçları kendi web sitelerinden indirebilirsiniz. Ama eğer retoolkit'i indirirseniz, muhtemelen zamandan tasarruf edersiniz. Buna ilaveten, araçlar önceden yapılandırıldığından dolayı; birkaç eklentiye sahip x64dbg, her dizinden çalışan komut satırı araçları vb. gibi şeyler bulacaksınız. Eğer yeni bir analiz sanal makinesi kuruyorsanız, bunu beğenebilirsiniz.

# İndirmek için

Görmüş olduğunuz *.iss dosyaları, [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) ile oluşturulmuş kurulum dosyamızın kaynak kodlarıdır. Aracın kendisini indirmek için, [Yayınlar](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/releases) bölümüne gidip kurulum programını indirmelisiniz.

# Dahil edilen araçlar

Detaylı bir liste için [wiki](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/wiki)'ye bir göz atın.

# Kendi ortamıma kurmak güvenli mi?

Bilmiyorum. Dahil edilen araçlardan bazıları açık kaynak değil ve karanlık alemlerden geliyorlar. Bu programı sadece sanal makinelerde ve kendi sorumluluğunuzda kullanmalısınız.

# X aracını ekleyebilir miyim?

Bu değişkendir. Ana fikir projeyi basit tutmaktır. Sadece burada olmadığından dolayı bir aracı ekleyemeyiz. Ama eğer iyi bir sebebinizin olduğunu düşünürseniz, ve lisans bize yazılımı yeniden dağıtmak için izin verirse, lütfen [buradan yeni bir konu açın](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/issues?q=label%3Atool-request+).

# Değişim kütüğü

### 2022.04

* Eklenenler:
    * Echo Mirage
    * elfparser-ng
    * entropy \[[#47](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/issues/47)\]
    * Force Toolkit
    * MiniDump x64dbg eklentisi
    * Notepad++
    * OllyDumpEx x64dbg eklentisi \[[#41](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/issues/41)\]
* Çıkarılanlar:
    * Bewareircd: Şimdilerde nadir IRC tabanlı haberleşmeleri analiz etmek için fazla özgül.
    * dnSpy: dnSpyEx ile değiştirildi.
    * HyperDBG: İyi bir proje, fakat henüz binary yayınlamadıklarından dolayı benim için çok fazla iş çıkacaktı.
    * JRE: Ghidra tarafından ihtiyaç duyulan JDK ile değiştirildi.

# 逆向工程师的工具包

## 这是一个什么工具？

如果你对x86和x64 Windows系统上的逆向工程和/或恶意软件分析感兴趣，这是你可能喜欢的工具集。安装这个程序后，您必须使用以下方法访问工具：

* 双击桌面上的 `retoolkit` 图标。
* 在一个文件上点击右键，选择`Send to(发送至) -> retoolkit` 。这样，所选的文件就会作为参数传给所需的程序 。

![](assets/retoolkit.gif)

## 我为什么需要它？

你不知道。显然，你可以从他们自己的网站上下载这些工具，然后自己在一个新的虚拟机中安装它们。但是，如果你下载retoolkit，它可能可以为你节省一些时间。此外，这些工具都是预先配置好的，所以你会发现像x64dbg这样的东西有一些插件，命令行工具在任何目录下工作，等等。如果你正在建立一个新的分析虚拟机，你可能会喜欢它。

## 下载

你在这里看到的*.iss 文件，是我们用 [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)建立的安装程序的源代码。要下载真正的安装包，你必须到 [Releases](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/releases) 部分去下载安装程序。

## 包含的工具

请看[wiki](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/wiki) 的详细清单。

## 在我的环境中安装它是安全的吗？

我不知道。一些包含的工具不是开源的，而且来自不光彩的地方。你应该只在虚拟机中使用它，并由你自己负责。

## 你可以添加工具X吗？

这取决于。我们的想法是让它保持简单。我们不会因为一个工具还不在这里就添加它。但如果你认为有一个很好的理由这样做，而且许可证允许我们重新分配软件，如果它还没有退出，请在这里提一个 [issue](https://github.com/mentebinaria/retoolkit/issues?q=label%3Atool-request+) 。
