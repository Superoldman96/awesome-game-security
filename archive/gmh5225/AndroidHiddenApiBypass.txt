      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# AndroidHiddenApiBypass

[![Android CI status](https://github.com/LSPosed/AndroidHiddenApiBypass/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/LSPosed/AndroidHiddenApiBypass/actions/workflows/android.yml)

Bypass restrictions on non-SDK interfaces.

## Why AndroidHiddenApiBypass?

- Pure Java: no native code used.
- Reliable: does not rely on specific behaviors, so it will not be blocked like meta-reflection or `dexfile`.
- Stable: `unsafe`, art structs and `setHiddenApiExemptions` are stable APIs.

[How it works (Chinese)](https://lovesykun.cn/archives/android-hidden-api-bypass.html)

## Integration

Gradle:

```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.lsposed.hiddenapibypass:hiddenapibypass:4.3'
}
```

## Usage

1. Invoke a restricted method:
    ```java
    HiddenApiBypass.invoke(ApplicationInfo.class, new ApplicationInfo(), "usesNonSdkApi"/*, args*/)
    ```
1. Invoke restricted constructor:
    ```java
    Object instance = HiddenApiBypass.newInstance(Class.forName("android.app.IActivityManager$Default")/*, args*/);
    ```
1. Get all methods including restricted ones from a class:
    ```java
    var allMethods = HiddenApiBypass.getDeclaredMethods(ApplicationInfo.class);
    ((Method).stream(allMethods).filter(e -> e.getName().equals("usesNonSdkApi")).findFirst().get()).invoke(new ApplicationInfo());
    ```
1. Get all non-static fields including restricted ones from a class:
    ```java
    var allInstanceFields = HiddenApiBypass.getInstanceFields(ApplicationInfo.class);
    ((Method).stream(allInstanceFields).filter(e -> e.getName().equals("longVersionCode")).findFirst().get()).get(new ApplicationInfo());
    ```
1. Get all static fields including restricted ones from a class:
    ```java
    var allStaticFields = HiddenApiBypass.getStaticFields(ApplicationInfo.class);
    ((Method).stream(allInstanceFields).filter(e -> e.getName().equals("HIDDEN_API_ENFORCEMENT_DEFAULT")).findFirst().get()).get(null);
    ```
1. Get specific class method or class constructor
    ```java
    var ctor = HiddenApiBypass.getDeclaredConstructor(ClipDrawable.class /*, args */);
    var method = HiddenApiBypass.getDeclaredMethod(ApplicationInfo.class, "getHiddenApiEnforcementPolicy" /*, args */);
    ```
1. Add a class to exemption list:
    ```java
    HiddenApiBypass.addHiddenApiExemptions(
        "Landroid/content/pm/ApplicationInfo;", // one specific class
        "Ldalvik/system" // all classes in packages dalvik.system
        "Lx" // all classes whose full name is started with x
    );
    ```
    if you are going to add all classes to exemption list, just leave an empty prefix:
    ```java
    HiddenApiBypass.addHiddenApiExemptions("");
    ```

#
#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or
#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole
#       command line, like:
#
#           ksh Gradle
#
#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script
#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:
#         * functions;
#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,
#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;
#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;
#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».
#
#   Important for patching:
#
#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided
#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.
#
#       The "traditional" practice of packing multiple parameters into a
#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security
#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating
#       options in "$@", and eventually passing that to Java.
#
#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,
#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;
#       see the in-line comments for details.
#
#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,
#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.
#
#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template
#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt
#       within the Gradle project.
