      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# CallStack-Spoofer

A simple tool that will make it harder to find your code by stackwalker or other stack analyze.<br/>
This works both in the kernel-mode and in the user-mode.<br/>
~~Safe with runtime exceptions.~~<br/>

[PoC](#PoC)

### example in user-mode
```cpp
SPOOF_FUNC;//spoof current function
SPOOF_CALL(Beep)(500, 500);//spoof system call
```

### example in kernel-mode
```cpp
SPOOF_FUNC;//spoof current function
SPOOF_CALL(NTSTATUS,NtClose)(handle);//spoof system call
```
### call by pointer
```cpp
BOOL (WINAPI * beep)(_In_ DWORD dwFreq,_In_ DWORD dwDuration)=&Beep;
SPOOF_CALL(*beep)(500,500);//need dereference
```

### presetting
- For kernel- disable Control Flow Guard (CFG) (/guard:cf in msvc)<br/>
- Developed for the x64 platform.<br/>
- Requires changes for x32.<br/>

### c++ standart
- Usermode c++17 and above<br/>
- Kernelmode c++14 and above

### PoC

There are 2 modes of operation:
 1. Erase the return address of the current function and restore it when the destructor is called during the return of the function. Since we are using a class with a local scope, we will call the destructor anyway. This also works with exceptions.
 2. Generate a shellcode that will proxy our system calls, as a result of which the return address will not point to our code.

While the first case is simple, the second case is a bit more complicated. What should we know? The function template generates a function at compile time with certain parameters that we call it with in the code. Subsequent calls will use the already generated function. Therefore, we can get the address of the generated function like this:
```cpp
PVOID self_addr = static_cast<PVOID>(&ShellCodeGenerator<RetType, Func*, Args&&...>);
```
With each subsequent same call, the address will match. Therefore, we can cache our matched shellcode and template function address pairs so that we only allocate the shellcode once and then use it. For backwards compatibility with the kernel, no standard containers are used.

It is important to understand that no function calls should be used in the shellcode, except for calls via direct addresses, because the calls use **nearcall**, and we will get an invalid relative call.
We also encrypt our return address with xor , because it will still be stored on the stack.

~~It was written in a hurry, so there are flaws here.~~
