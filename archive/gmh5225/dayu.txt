                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published
    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see

# dayu
dayu (pronounced /ta˥˨ y˨˩˨/, loosely daa-jyu /dɑːjuː/) is a parser and (very rudimentary) decompiler for the .abc files (Ark Bytecode files) used on Open/HarmonyOS.

*Dayu*, or [Yu the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great), was an ancient Chinese king credited with successfully coping with the Great Flood and thus saving people from suffering. On a similar note, Noah's Ark helped lives survive the Deluge. In a broad sense, dayu represented/represents Ark in another form. 

**Disclaimer**: dayu is a toy project developed in my free time. My availability and expertise are limited, so decompilation correctness and future maintenance are NOT guaranteed. Use at your own risk. This is a free and open-source project; don't expect too much from it.

## Usage
### As a standalone command-line tool
See "Examples" section below for an example use.

```
usage: main.py [-h] [-pc] [-pmc CLASS] [-dmo] [-dc DECOMPILE_CLASS] [-dme DECOMPILE_METHOD] [-cfg] [-abc ABC] [-pa PA]
               [-O OUTPUT_LEVEL]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -pc, --print-classes  print names of all classes
  -pmc CLASS, --print-methods-in-class CLASS
                        print names of all methods (including their class names) in the specified CLASS
  -dmo, --decompile-module
                        decompile the whole file
  -dc DECOMPILE_CLASS, --decompile-class DECOMPILE_CLASS
                        decompile all methods in the specified class
  -dme DECOMPILE_METHOD, --decompile-method DECOMPILE_METHOD
                        decompile the specified method; must be specified in the format "<class name>.<method name>"
  -cfg, --view-cfg      display the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of the specified method (graphviz required); must specify
                        method with -dme
  -abc ABC              specify the input abc file
  -pa PA                specify the input text-form Panda Assembly file
  -O OUTPUT_LEVEL, --output-level OUTPUT_LEVEL
                        output decompiled code at the specified level (possible values: llir, mlir, hlir, pcode,
                        default: pcode)
```

### In Python code
Example:

```python
from ark.abcreader import AbcReader
from decompile.config import DecompilerConfig, DecompileGranularity, DecompileOutputLevel
from decompile.decompiler import Decompiler
from pandasm.reader import PandasmReader

# specify input files, Panda Assembly file (obtained by using ark_disasm tool from the SDK) is required for decompilation
abcfile = AbcReader.from_file('<path to abc file>')
pafile = PandasmReader.from_file('<path to Panda Assembly file>')

# configure the decompiler
config = DecompilerConfig({
    'abc': abcfile,
    'pandasm': pafile,
    'output_level': DecompileOutputLevel.PSEUDOCODE,
    'class': '<name of class containing the method to decompile>',
    'method': '<name of method to decompile>',
    'granularity': DecompileGranularity.METHOD
})

# ready, steady, go!
decompiler = Decompiler(config)
method = decompiler.decompile()

# print the decompiled code
decompiler.print_code(method)

# view the CFG
decompiler.write_cfg_to_file(method, f'cfg/cfg_{method.name}', True)
```

## Examples
Suppose we have this simple snippet of code and we've compiled it into [modules.12.abc](examples/modules.12.abc):

```typescript
function foo() {
    let i = 0
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      hilog.info(0x0, 'hello', `world${i}`)
    }
    return i
}
```

Use `ark_disasm` from HarmonyOS SDK to obtain Panda Assembly [modules.12.abc.txt](examples/modules.12.abc.txt):
```shell
ark_disasm modules.12.abc modules.12.abc.txt
```

Print names of all classes in Panda Assembly:
```shell
python main.py -pa modules.12.abc.txt -pc
```

Assuming our method to decompile is in the class `com.example.myapplication.entry.ets.pages.Index`, print names of all methods in this class with:
```shell
python main.py -pa modules.12.abc.txt -pmc com.example.myapplication.entry.ets.pages.Index
```

We see that the full name of our `foo` method is `com.example.myapplication.entry.ets.pages.Index.foo`. Decompile with:
```shell
python main.py -abc modules.12.abc -pa modules.12.abc.txt -dme com.example.myapplication.entry.ets.pages.Index.foo
```

After decompiling using the default configuration, this is what we get:

```typescript
let v0, v1, v2 
v0 = 0x0
jump_label_1:
while (v0 < 0x5) { 
import { default } as hilog from '@ohos:hilog';
v1 = __is_hole__(hilog)
if (v1 == true) throw 'Value of "hilog" is undefined'
v2 = hilog.info(hilog, 0x0, "hello", (("world" + v0) + ""))
v2 = __ToNumeric__(v0)
v0 = (v2 + 0x1)
} 
jump_label_0:
v2 = v0
return v2
```

Now, let's try it on a method in one of Huawei's sample ArkTS projects. This is the source code:

![](docs/imgs/src_cropImage.png)

Decompiled:

![](docs/imgs/cfg_cropImage.png)

There's an unsupported `try-catch` structure, and the result is more tedious and harder to read now, but it's basically correct.

## Caveats
As much as dayu tries to output code that conforms to the syntax of ArkTS/TypeScript, this isn't always possible or easy to achieve (for me). Some points to note:  

First, since dayu is still limited in its control flow structure recovery, the final pseudocode may be littered with `goto`s (in the form of `jump` statements). ArkTS (as well as TypeScript) doesn't support `goto`, so the user will have to sort some of the control flow out for themselves.

Second, in the final pseudocode, there may be some "pseudo-functions". They stand for operations that can't be easily translated. For example, variable definition assertion is represented as `__assert_defined__`.

Some pseudo-functions can be manually implemented. For example, `__assert_defined__` may be implemented as:

```typescript
function __assert_defined__(obj) {
    if (typeof obj == "undefined") {
        throw "undefined"
    }
} 
```

## Documentation
[Under the Hood - how dayu works](docs/how_it_works.md)

## Known Issues
- Slow. Very slow. Largely caused by two things: Panda Assembly parsing and copy propagation, both of which are badly written.
- Limited coverage of the instruction set
- Loop structures and conditional structures are not recovered in some cases
- No support for `try-catch` structures
- Lack of type analysis (both ArkTS and TypeScript are typed)

# 蒲篮
蒲篮是 Open/HarmonyOS 系统所使用的 .abc 文件（方舟字节码文件）的解析器和（不成熟的）反编译器。

在希伯来语《圣经》中，蒲篮和方舟是同一个词。经文记载，摩西出生时，埃及法老下令杀死所有希伯来人的男婴，摩西的母亲为保其性命，将他装入蒲草篮放在尼罗河畔，摩西被路过的埃及公主收养，得以死里逃生。蒲篮与方舟一样象征着拯救，可以说是另一种形式的方舟。

**免责声明**：蒲篮是个人业余开发的玩具项目，由于个人能力及时间有限，不保证反编译准确性和未来的维护，使用风险自担。本项目属自由开源项目，请不要抱太高期望。

## 用法
### 命令行工具
后文“演示”一节中有使用命令行的例子。

```
usage: main.py [-h] [-pc] [-pmc CLASS] [-dmo] [-dc DECOMPILE_CLASS] [-dme DECOMPILE_METHOD] [-cfg] [-abc ABC] [-pa PA]
               [-O OUTPUT_LEVEL]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -pc, --print-classes  print names of all classes
  -pmc CLASS, --print-methods-in-class CLASS
                        print names of all methods (including its class name) in the specified CLASS
  -dmo, --decompile-module
                        decompile the whole file
  -dc DECOMPILE_CLASS, --decompile-class DECOMPILE_CLASS
                        decompile all methods in the specified class
  -dme DECOMPILE_METHOD, --decompile-method DECOMPILE_METHOD
                        decompile the specified method; must be specified in the format "<class name>.<method name>"
  -cfg, --view-cfg      display the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of the specified method (graphviz required); must specify
                        method with -dme
  -abc ABC              specify the input abc file
  -pa PA                specify the input text-form Panda Assembly file
  -O OUTPUT_LEVEL, --output-level OUTPUT_LEVEL
                        output decompiled code at the specified level (possible values: llir, mlir, hlir, pcode,
                        default: pcode)
```

### Python 调用
示例：

```python
from ark.abcreader import AbcReader
from decompile.config import DecompilerConfig, DecompileGranularity, DecompileOutputLevel
from decompile.decompiler import Decompiler
from pandasm.reader import PandasmReader

# 指定输入文件，文本形式的方舟字节码（Panda Assembly，可通过 SDK 中的 ark_disasm 反汇编 abc 得到）为反编译所必需的输入
abcfile = AbcReader.from_file('<abc 文件路径>')
pafile = PandasmReader.from_file('<Panda Assembly 文件路径>')

# 配置反编译器
config = DecompilerConfig({
    'abc': abcfile,
    'pandasm': pafile,
    'output_level': DecompileOutputLevel.PSEUDOCODE,
    'class': '<要反编译的方法所在类名>',
    'method': '<要反编译的方法名>',
    'granularity': DecompileGranularity.METHOD
})

# 开始反编译
decompiler = Decompiler(config)
method = decompiler.decompile()

# 打印反编译结果
decompiler.print_code(method)

# 查看 CFG
decompiler.write_cfg_to_file(method, f'cfg/cfg_{method.name}', True)
```

## 演示
假设有如下源码，已编译成 [modules.12.abc](examples/modules.12.abc)：

```typescript
function foo() {
    let i = 0
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      hilog.info(0x0, 'hello', `world${i}`)
    }
    return i
}
```

先用 HarmonyOS SDK 中的 `ark_disasm` 工具反汇编得到 Panda Assembly [modules.12.abc.txt](examples/modules.12.abc.txt)：
```shell
ark_disasm modules.12.abc modules.12.abc.txt
```

打印 Panda Assembly 中的所有类名：
```shell
python main.py -pa modules.12.abc.txt -pc
```

假设要反编译的方法位于类 `com.example.myapplication.entry.ets.pages.Index` 中，打印其所有方法名：
```shell
python main.py -pa modules.12.abc.txt -pmc com.example.myapplication.entry.ets.pages.Index
```

可以看到 `foo` 方法的全名 `com.example.myapplication.entry.ets.pages.Index.foo`。反编译：
```shell
python main.py -abc modules.12.abc -pa modules.12.abc.txt -dme com.example.myapplication.entry.ets.pages.Index.foo
```

以默认配置反编译后，结果如下：

```typescript
let v0, v1, v2 
v0 = 0x0
jump_label_1:
while (v0 < 0x5) { 
import { default } as hilog from '@ohos:hilog';
v1 = __is_hole__(hilog)
if (v1 == true) throw 'Value of "hilog" is undefined'
v2 = hilog.info(hilog, 0x0, "hello", (("world" + v0) + ""))
v2 = __ToNumeric__(v0)
v0 = (v2 + 0x1)
} 
jump_label_0:
v2 = v0
return v2
```

现在尝试反编译华为提供的 ArkTS 示范代码中的一个方法，源码如下：

![](docs/imgs/src_cropImage.png)

反编译后：

![](docs/imgs/cfg_cropImage.png)

这次出现了不支持的 `try-catch` 结构，反编译结果也更冗长难读了，但基本上还是正确的。

## 注意事项
蒲篮尽可能输出合法的 ArkTS/TypeScript 代码，但不是所有情况都能够做到或者容易做到这一点。

首先，蒲篮对高级语言控制流结构的恢复仍然无法覆盖所有分支结构和循环结构，因此输出的伪代码中可能会存在 `goto` 语句（表现为 `jump <标签名>`）。ArkTS 和 TypeScript 都不支持 `goto`，所以用户需要自己理清控制流并相应改写伪代码。

其次，在反编译出来的伪代码中，可能存在一些“伪函数”，用于代表无法方便地翻译成伪代码的一些操作。例如，断言某变量有定义的操作由 `__assert_defined__` 来代表。

某些伪函数可以手动实现，例如 `__assert_defined__` 可以实现为：

```typescript
function __assert_defined__(obj) {
    if (typeof obj == "undefined") {
        throw "undefined"
    }
} 
```

## 文档
[蒲篮是怎样编成的 - 工作原理](docs/how_it_works_zh_simp.md)

## 已知问题
- 反编译速度极慢，主要是因为文本方舟字节码的解析和复制传播写得很烂，复杂度太高
- 支持的指令较少
- 循环结构和条件结构在部分情况下无法恢复
- 不支持 `try-catch` 结构
- 缺少类型分析（ArkTS 和 TypeScript 都是有类型的）

# Under the Hood - how dayu works
The dayu decompiler works by first translating the bytecode into an intermediate representation (IR), and then translating the IR into pseudocode. This process consists of several stages, as shown in the following diagram.

![](imgs/decompiler_workflow.png)

We'll show you what the following method looks like at these stages to give you an idea of how the code is transformed.

```typescript
function foo() {
    let i = 0
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      hilog.info(0x0, 'hello', `world${i}`)
    }
    return i
}
```

## Stage 1: Bytecode to Raw IR
This stage simply parses Panda Assembly, extracts bytecode instructions, and puts them into dayu's internal structures (e.g., an `NAddressCode` for each instruction). Subsequent analysis and translation will be performed on these internal structures only.

<details>
    <summary><b>Example: Raw IR</b></summary>

The Raw IR for the example method is:

![](imgs/raw_ir_example.png)
</details>

## Stage 2: Raw IR to LLIR
In this stage, we build the Control Flow Graph (CFG) based on Raw IR, and lift Raw IR to LLIR. We aim to represent the operations of the original bytecode with a restricted and standardized set of IR instructions. This unified form facilitates analysis and decompilation.

The process of translating from a lower-level language to a higher-level one is known as *lifting*. We write a lifter method for each Ark opcode, in which we determine which type of LLIR instruction this should be (e.g., an assignment, or an unconditional jump) and what arguments it has. Then we replace the Raw IR instruction with an LLIR one/LLIR ones created using said information. One Raw IR instruction may translate into multiple LLIR instructions if its operation is complex (e.g., requiring pseudo-functions).

LLIR and MLIR instructions are something like the [Three-Address Code](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~mmorenom/CS447/Lectures/IntermediateCode.html/node3.html) (TAC), except that function calls may have more than three arguments. Therefore, they are called `NAddressCode`s or NACs instead.

At the time of writing, there are eight types of NACs:
- ASSIGN: assignment statements, takes at most three arguments
- UNCOND_JUMP: unconditional jump statements, takes exactly one argument
- COND_JUMP: conditional jump statements, takes exactly three arguments
- CALL: function/method call statements, takes at least one argument (the function/method name)
- RETURN: return statements, takes exactly one argument
- UNCOND_THROW: unconditional throw statements, takes exactly one argument
- COND_THROW: conditional throw statements, takes exactly three arguments
- UNKNOWN: reserved for code that is not "proper" IR (not having their `NAddressCode` fields properly set up), e.g. Raw IR or pseudocode, sometimes HLIR too

In the lifter methods, Raw IR will be converted to LLIR that consists of NACs of these types only. For example, the Raw IR instruction `lda v2` (assign `v2` to `acc`) will become a NAC of `ASSIGN` type, with arguments `acc` and `v2`.

### IR format constraints
In order to keep analysis easy, NACs follow a particular format at LLIR and MLIR levels. The complete format may be detailed later in a separate document (that is, if I have the time), but some general rules can be laid down right now:

- Each NAC allows at most three arguments (with a few exceptions detailed in the next point). The precise number allowed for each NAC type has been described above.
- `CALL` NACs can have more than three arguments. Expression arguments (more on this later) can have arguments within themselves. For example, in the NAC `v0 = (v1 + 1) + 2`, the second argument is an expression argument `(v1 + 1)`, which itself has two arguments `v1` and `1`. Nevertheless, this NAC is still, in form, a three-argument one (i.e. the expression argument is seen as a whole).
- The order of arguments matters, and each position has its meaning. For example, the first argument for an `ASSIGN` NAC is always the destination of assignment.
- Arguments are usually wrapped inside `PandasmInsnArgument`s, and they have types too (e.g., `reg` for register arguments).
- One type of argument, `ExprArg`, which represents expressions, allows nesting (i.e. expressions within expressions, like `(v1 + (v2 + 3))`. To keep things simple, each `arith`-type expression takes one operator and at most two operands/arguments.
- Property accesses are treated as one argument of `field` type and with a reference object, as opposed to two arguments. For example, `v0["set"]` is an argument of type `field` and with value `"set"`. Its reference object is `v0`.
- Reference objects are not nested, i.e. a reference object can't be an argument with a reference object. This ensures complicated array accesses like `acc["foo"]["bar"]` don't occur in the IR.
- There is at most one argument with a reference object in a single NAC.

Any manipulation in Stages 2 and 3 is carried out carefully so as not to break these constraints, and many manipulations presume that these constraints hold true.  

<details>
    <summary><b>Example: LLIR</b></summary>

The LLIR for the example method is:

![](imgs/llir_example.png)
</details>

## Stage 3: LLIR to MLIR
A powerful tool known as data flow analysis is employed in this stage to simplify LLIR. The output, MLIR, should ideally be a medium form that is easier for humans to read than LLIR, and that allows convenient analysis for machines.

In this stage, we take extra care that the IR constraints are not violated, hence the name "constrained data flow analysis". A constrained analysis guarantees its output can be used as input to itself or another analysis, thanks to its constraint-preserving property.

Mainly two data flow analyses are performed: live variable analysis (LVA) and dead code elimination (DCE). A third analysis, copy propagation, is a bit computationally expensive, and is therefore postponed to Stage 4 by default. Peephole optimization (PO) is also performed, although it's not a data flow analysis.

LVA determines which variables are dead (not used) after a certain point in a program. DCE is predicated on LVA, and it eliminates NACs whose result is never used (i.e. dead code). Consider the following NACs:

```
v1 = acc
v2 = acc
v1 = v3
```

DCE will remove the first NAC since the result of this assignment is overwritten by the third NAC and thus useless.

PO matches certain patterns in the code and rewrites them in a more concise fashion. For instance, the NAC pattern

```
a = b
b = a
```

is obviously redundant and can be rewritten as

```
a = b
```

LVA, DCE, and PO are executed repeatedly because after each iteration, some NACs may be optimized away and new dead code or optimizable patterns may emerge. We stop once no code changes after an iteration.

<details>
    <summary><b>Example: MLIR</b></summary>

The MLIR for the example method is:

![](imgs/mlir_example.png)
</details>

## Stage 4: MLIR to HLIR
We continue to do data flow analysis, but this time in an unconstrained way. "Unconstrained" means some of the IR format constraints may be broken, and as a result, the output can't be fed into an LLIR or MLIR analysis pass anymore.

This stage involves an important analysis, copy propagation (CP). Put simply, CP tries to replace all uses of a variable with its defined value. For example, if we have

```
v1 = acc
acc = v1 + 1
```

where the first NAC is a copy (assignment) that defines `v1` and the second NAC uses `v1`. CP will replace the second `v1` with what it was defined to be, i.e. `acc`:

```
v1 = acc
acc = acc + 1
```

The astute reader may have noticed that the first NAC is now useless and can be swept away with DCE. In fact, in this stage, we follow CP immediately with DCE.

We also perform unconstrained PO here.

<details>
    <summary><b>Example: HLIR</b></summary>

The HLIR for the example method is:

![](imgs/hlir_example.png)
</details>

## Stage 5: HLIR to pseudocode
Structured control flow is a hallmark of virtually all high-level programming languages. It's thus imperative to recover control flow structures (e.g., `if-else`, `while` loops) if we aim for high-level, human-readable pseudocode.

One of the classical algorithms for recovering control flow structures from a CFG is *structural analysis*. The basic idea behind it is fairly simple and straightforward. We start with a given CFG and match patterns in it. Certain patterns of connected basic blocks constitute a *region*, of which there are two types: acyclic and cyclic. Acyclic regions include `if-then`, `if-else-then`, and sequential blocks. Cyclic regions include self loops, `while` loops, and natural loops. The exact constructs may vary between languages, but these are what dayu deals with.

Let's take the `if-else-then` region as an example.

![](imgs/if-else-then.png)

In this diagram, Blocks B, C, and D make up an `if-else-then` region, because they fit the pattern of that kind of region: one conditional block which has two successors, and one successor isn't a successor to the other, nor does either of them go back to the conditional block.

Now that a region match is found, we rewrite the code as:

```
<Block B>
if (...) {
    <Block C>
} else {
    <Block D>
}
```

where the `if` condition is taken from the last instruction in Block B, and then *reduce* (or merge) the region into a single block, say Block B', containing the rewritten code. Next, we have three sequential blocks (A, B', and E), which again is a kind of acyclic region and can be reduced. Finally, we're left with only one block and the algorithm terminates. In real-world cases, there are probably much more regions, so we may need to reduce over and over again until one block remains.

Beyond the general principles, there are further details that need consideration. Firstly, inner nested constructs should be processed before outer ones. Secondly, sometimes, we may encounter *improper* regions, ones that don't fit into any of the predefined patterns. They are generally dealt with by cutting one or more edges to transform the region in question into a proper one. The severed edges are replaced with a `goto` at the end of their source blocks. dayu doesn't handle improper regions for now.

Also done in Stage 5 are variable allocation, which renames registers into variables, and some minor optimizations to make the code more readable.

Congratulations! You've arrived at the destination: pseudocode. It's been a tiring journey, but (hopefully) a rewarding one too. This is the end (or is it...?).

## Appendix: Data Flow Analysis
Data flow analysis features prominently in static program analysis. It answers questions about how data propagates throughout the program by modelling the effects of certain elements, from instructions, via basic blocks and functions, to the entire program. For simplicity, we'll confine our discussion to intraprocedural analysis—analysis of functions and smaller units.

First, let's go over some commonly used concepts in data flow analysis.

A *program point* exists before the first instruction, after the last instruction, and between any two instructions in a function. We say "at program point *p*" to mean the program is in such a state that the instructions before *p* have been executed, but those after have not.

A *definition* of a variable occurs when a value is assigned/reassigned to it. A *use* of a variable refers to when its defined value is accessed (but not changed). *Killing* a definition means the value assigned by the definition is no longer valid because a new value has been assigned.

Next, determine your goal. What information do you want to know about the function? Perhaps you're interested in whether a definition is still valid at a certain program point. This analysis is what we call *reaching definitions* (RD), which we'll use as an example moving forward.

Then, depending on your goal, model the effects of an instruction. For RD, "effects" means what variables this instruction defines and what previous definitions it kills.

Next, extend the modelling to basic blocks. For each block, you'll need to keep a `gen` set for new definitions (that are not killed) in this block, and a `kill` set for definitions in the function that are killed by this block. Note that this step is essentially the same as what's done in the last step, except applied on a basic block scale. Start with empty sets and modify them as you analyze each instruction. Do this for every basic block. 

Last, once we have the sets ready for all blocks, we can combine the results to obtain RD information for the entire function. Take the definitions valid at the entry of a block (of which there are none if this is the first block, since no variables have been defined yet), remove those in the `kill` set of the block, and then add those in the `gen` set. The result is the definitions valid at the exit of the block, which are also valid at the entry of its successors. Repeat this process for the successors, and the successors to successors... The algorithm will eventually converge, and by then we'll know what variables are valid at the end of any block. More details on the algorithm can be found in compiler textbooks and on the internet.

# 蒲篮是怎样编成的 - 工作原理
蒲篮反编译器先将字节码转换为中间表示（IR），再将 IR 转换为伪代码。此过程可分为几阶段，如下图所示：

![](imgs/decompiler_workflow_zh_simp.png)

后文会以如下函数为例，给出反编译各个阶段该函数的样子。

```typescript
function foo() {
    let i = 0
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      hilog.info(0x0, 'hello', `world${i}`)
    }
    return i
}
```

## 阶段 1：字节码转原始 IR
本阶段的工作是解析 Panda Assembly 反汇编结果，从中提取出各条指令，并将指令存入内部的结构体中（每条指令放入一个 `NAddressCode` 中）。后续的分析和翻译只会基于这些内部结构开展。

<details>
    <summary><b>示例：原始 IR</b></summary>

示例函数的原始 IR 形式如下：

![](imgs/raw_ir_example.png)
</details>

## 阶段 2：原始 IR 转低级 IR
在本阶段中，基于原始 IR 构建控制流图（CFG），并将原始 IR 提升为低级 IR。该阶段目标是用一组有限的、标准化的 IR 指令来表示原始字节码的操作，这种统一的形式有助于分析和反编译。

从较低级语言向较高级语言转换的过程称为**提升**。对于方舟的每种操作码，我们编写一个提升函数，提升函数负责确定该条原始 IR 指令对应于哪种类型的低级 IR 指令（如赋值指令、无条件跳转指令），并相应处理其参数。然后创建一条或多条低级 IR 指令来替代原始 IR 指令，如果该条指令所表示的操作较为复杂（例如需要伪函数），则一条原始 IR 指令可能对应为多条低级 IR 指令。

低级和中级 IR 指令类似于[三地址码](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/549728632#h_549728632_5)，但函数调用可能会有多于三个参数，因此代码中将这些指令称为 `NAddressCode`，意为“N 地址码”，简称 NAC。

截至目前，有八种类型的 NAC：
- ASSIGN: 赋值语句，最多接受三个参数
- UNCOND_JUMP: 无条件跳转语句，仅接受一个参数
- COND_JUMP: 条件跳转语句，仅接受三个参数
- CALL: 函数/方法调用语句，至少接受一个参数（即函数/方法名）
- RETURN: 返回语句，仅接受一个参数
- UNCOND_THROW: 无条件抛出异常语句，仅接受一个参数
- COND_THROW: 条件抛出异常语句，仅接受三个参数
- UNKNOWN: 专为非“合式” IR 指令（指其 `NAddressCode` 中的字段非完全设置好的状态）使用，例如原始 IR 指令、伪代码指令，有时也包含某些高级 IR 指令

提升函数把原始 IR 转换为低级 IR，低级 IR 由一条条以上类型之一的 NAC 组成。例如，一条原始 IR 指令 `lda v2`（将 `v2` 赋值给 `acc`）会变成一条 `ASSIGN` 类型的 NAC，其参数为 `acc` 和 `v2`。

### IR 格式限制
为分析简便起见，低级和中级 IR 的 NAC 遵循特定的格式。完整的格式后续若有时间会另开文档说明，在此只列出大略：

- 每条 NAC 至多允许三个参数（有少许例外，下条中说明）。每种 NAC 具体允许几个参数，上文已给出。
- `CALL` 类型的 NAC 可以有多于三个参数。表达式参数（详见后文）中可以嵌套参数，例如，`v0 = (v1 + 1) + 2` 这条 NAC 中，第二个参数是表达式参数 `(v1 + 1)`，其自身又由两个参数 `v1` 和 `1` 组成。但是，该条 NAC 形式上仍被视为是三参数的（即表达式参数视为整体）。
- 参数是有顺序的，每个位置有其意义。例如，`ASSIGN` 类型的 NAC 的第一个参数总表示赋值的目的地。
- 参数一般封装在 `PandasmInsnArgument` 中，各有其类型（如 `reg` 表示寄存器参数）。
- `ExprArg` 封装表达式参数，该类型的参数允许嵌套（即表达式中含表达式，如 `(v1 + (v2 + 3))`）。为保证分析不过于复杂，每个 `arith` 类型的表达式只有一个运算符和至多两个操作数/参数。
- 属性访问视为一个 `field` 类型且带有引用对象的参数，而非两个参数。例如，`v0["set"]` 是一个 `field` 类型的参数，值为 `"set"`，引用对象是 `v0`。
- 引用对象不嵌套，即引用对象不能又是一个带引用对象的参数。这样保证形如 `acc["foo"]["bar"]` 的多重属性访问不会出现在 IR 中。
- 一条 NAC 中至多只有一个带引用对象的参数。

阶段 2 和阶段 3 的操作都特别注意不会违背上述的限制，代码中许多操作也默认以上述限制为前提。

<details>
    <summary><b>示例：低级 IR</b></summary>

示例函数的低级 IR 形式如下：

![](imgs/llir_example.png)
</details>

## 阶段 3：低级 IR 转中级 IR
该阶段使用了数据流分析这一强大的工具来简化低级 IR，我们期望，得到的输出即中级 IR 既能比低级 IR 便于人类阅读，又能便于机器分析。

本阶段会遵循上文阶段 2 所述的 IR 限制，因此在流程图中有“受限数据流分析”的说法。由于受限分析具有这种保持限制的特性，因此能保证其输出能够再被用作自身或另一分析的输入。

阶段 3 主要进行两种数据流分析：活跃变量分析和死代码消除。还有一种分析称为复制传播，由于其计算复杂度较高，默认推迟到阶段 4 进行。此外还进行窥孔优化，但窥孔优化不属于数据流分析。

活跃变量分析的任务是确定程序中某一点之后哪些变量不再活跃（即不再被使用）。死代码消除基于活跃变量分析，其任务是删除结果不会被用到的那些 NAC（即所谓死代码）。例如，给定下列 NAC：

```
v1 = acc
v2 = acc
v1 = v3
```

死代码消除会删掉第一条 NAC，因为这条赋值的结果被第三条 NAC 覆盖了，所以实际上其赋值是无用的。

窥孔优化的任务是匹配代码中特定的模式，并以更简洁的形式来改写。例如，下列模式

```
a = b
b = a
```

显然是冗余的，可以改写成：

```
a = b
```

活跃变量分析、死代码消除和窥孔优化会循环多次执行，因为每执行一遍，都可能有 NAC 被删除，从而可能产生新的死代码或可优化的模式。一旦执行完某一遍后代码没有发生改变，就停止循环。

<details>
    <summary><b>示例：中级 IR</b></summary>

示例函数的中级 IR 形式如下：

![](imgs/mlir_example.png)
</details>

## 阶段 4：中级 IR 转高级 IR
继续执行数据流分析，但这次是不受限的数据流分析。“不受限”指的是 IR 格式限制可能被打破，因此输出不能再被用作低级/中级 IR 分析 pass 的输入。

本阶段涉及一项重要的分析——复制传播。简单来说，复制传播会尝试把某变量的所有使用之处都替换为其定义时的值。试看下列代码：

```
v1 = acc
acc = v1 + 1
```

第一行是一句复制（即赋值），定义了 `v1`，第二行则使用了 `v1`。复制传播会把第二行的 `v1` 替换成其定义时的值，即 `acc`：

```
v1 = acc
acc = acc + 1
```

敏锐的读者可能已经发现，第一行现在变成了无用代码，可通过死代码消除来优化掉。事实上，本阶段中复制传播后确实接着进行了死代码消除。

本阶段还进行不受限的窥孔优化，此处不赘述。

<details>
    <summary><b>示例：高级 IR</b></summary>

示例函数的高级 IR 形式如下：

![](imgs/hlir_example.png)
</details>

## 阶段 5：高级 IR 转伪代码
几乎所有高级程序语言都支持结构化的控制流，因此若想得到可读性强的高级语言式伪代码，控制流结构（如 `if-else`、`while` 循环等）的还原是必不可少的。

从 CFG 还原控制流结构的经典算法之一称为**结构化分析**，其基本思想十分简单直观。该算法从一个给定的 CFG 开始，匹配其中的模式。以某些特定模式相连的块组成了所谓**区域**，分无环区域和有环区域。无环区域包括 `if-then`、`if-else-then` 和顺序块。有环区域则包括自循环、`while` 循环和自然循环。两种区域具体有哪些结构随语言而不同，以上列举的是蒲篮所处理的结构。

试以 `if-else-then` 区域举一例。

![](imgs/if-else-then.png)

上图中，每个 Block 代表一个基本块，块 B、C、D 一起组成一个 `if-else-then` 区域，因为它们符合这种区域的特征，即其中有一个带两个后继的条件块，且两后继任一个都不是另一个的后继，也不会往回走到条件块。

找到一个区域之后，就可以将代码重写为：

```
<Block B>
if (...) {
    <Block C>
} else {
    <Block D>
}
```

其中，`if` 的条件取自块 B 的最后一条指令。接着，将该区域**化简**（合并）为一个块 B'，其中包含重写后的代码。现在我们有三个相继的顺序块 A、B'、E，而顺序块也是一种无环区域，因而可以被化简。最终只留下一个块，算法结束。在实际的程序中，区域的数量可能会多得多，相应也会需要多次化简，直到只剩一个块。

除了大体的原理，还有一些细节需要考虑。首先，要先处理内层嵌套的结构，再处理外层嵌套的结构。其次，有时会遇到**非正常区域**（improper regions），指的是不能归入任何一个预先定义的模式的区域。这种区域的一般处理方式是切断其中一些边，使其转化为正常区域，而每条切断的边所代表的跳转，需要在其源块最后插入一条 `goto` 来等价表示。蒲篮目前不处理非正常区域。

阶段 5 还进行变量分配，即把寄存器重命名为变量，以及其他一些改善可读性的小优化。

到这里，我们就得到最终的伪代码了。

## 附录：数据流分析
数据流分析是静态程序分析中一种重要的技术，通过对指令、基本块、函数乃至整个程序所产生的效果进行建模，数据流分析能够回答数据是如何在程序中传播的。为了简化描述，在此只讨论过程内分析，即对函数和更小的单元进行的分析。

首先回顾数据流分析中的一些常用概念。

在函数的第一条指令之前、最后一条指令之后、每两条指令之间都存在一个**程序点**，说某程序“在程序点 *p*”意思是它处于这样一种状态：*p* 之前的指令都已经执行，而之后的指令尚未执行。

变量的**定义**是指一条对该变量进行赋值/重新赋值的指令。变量的**使用**是指一次对该变量值的访问（读取但不写入）。**杀死**某定义意思是该定义所赋予的值被新的值替代，从而不再有效。

接下来，确定你的分析目标。你想获得关于函数的什么信息？比如你想知道一个定义在某程序点是否还有效，此分析称为**到达定义分析**，后文将以此为例。

然后，根据目标来对指令的效果进行建模。对于到达定义分析来说，“效果”指的是这条指令定义了哪些变量，又杀死了之前的哪些定义。

再接着，将建模推广到基本块。对每个块维护一个 `gen` 集合，记录该块中没有被杀死的新定义，以及一个 `kill` 集合，记录函数的所有定义中，该块杀死的定义。这一步做的事其实和上一步差不多，只是这一步分析的是每个基本块定义和杀死的东西。最开始两集合都是空集，随着对一条条的指令分析，逐步修改集合，对每个块都重复这一过程。

最后，一旦所有块的两个集合都计算好了，就可以对整个函数计算最终的到达定义信息。从某个块的入口处开始，先得到在该处仍有效的定义（如果是第一个基本块，入口处有效定义显然为空集，因为此时还未定义任何变量），从中删除该块的 `kill` 集合中的所有定义，然后再加入 `gen` 集合中的所有定义，就得到该块出口处有效的定义，这些定义同时也必定在该块的后继入口处有效。对后继块、后继块的后继块等等重复此过程，算法最终会收敛，此时对任何一个块，我们都知道其出口处哪些变量定义有效了。该算法的细节可在编译原理教材或者网上找到。
