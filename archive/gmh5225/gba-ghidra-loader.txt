          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# gba-ghidra-loader
This is a Ghidra Loader for GameBoy Advance ROM files.

The memory areas and IO is mapped to the according addresses.
It parses the GBA Cartridge header of the ROM and sets the entry point accordingly.

The whole technical information of the GBA is taken from and perfectly documented by [gbatek](https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm).

The functionality is tested using Ghidra 10.1.2.

## Installation

### Install from release file (only applicable for specific ghidra version)

1. Download the .zip Ghidra Extension from the releases tab for the specific version.
2. Open Ghidra Project Window and add the loader by "File > Install Extensions"
3. Select the + icon and choose the downloaded .zip file
4. After importing, it should appear in the list. Click OK and restart Ghidra to use the loader.
5. The next time importing a valid GBA ROM file, the "GBA Loader" should appear at the import window.


### Install from source

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the repository directory
2. Set the `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` as described in the `build.gradle` file and build the Loader.
    ```bash
    $ export GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=<Absolute path to Ghidra>
    $ gradle
    
    # alternative:

    $ gradle -PGHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=<Absolute path to Ghidra>  
    ```
3. Open Ghidra Project Window and add the loader by "File > Install Extensions"
4. Select the + icon and choose the downloaded .zip file
5. After importing, it should appear in the list. Click OK and restart Ghidra to use the loader.
6. The next time importing a valid GBA ROM file, the "GBA Loader" should appear at the import window.


```

`build.gradle`:

```gradle
// Builds a Ghidra Extension for a given Ghidra installation.
//
// An absolute path to the Ghidra installation directory must be supplied either by setting the 
// GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR environment variable or Gradle project property:
//
//     > export GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=<Absolute path to Ghidra> 
//     > gradle
//
//         or
//
//     > gradle -PGHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=<Absolute path to Ghidra>
//
// Gradle should be invoked from the directory of the project to build.  Please see the
// application.gradle.version property in <GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR>/Ghidra/application.properties
// for the correction version of Gradle to use for the Ghidra installation you specify.

`data/README.txt`:

```txt
The "data" directory is intended to hold data files that will be used by this module and will
not end up in the .jar file, but will be present in the zip or tar file.  Typically, data
files are placed here rather than in the resources directory if the user may need to edit them.

An optional data/languages directory can exist for the purpose of containing various Sleigh language
specification files and importer opinion files.  

The data/buildLanguage.xml is used for building the contents of the data/languages directory.

The skel language definition has been commented-out within the skel.ldefs file so that the 
skeleton language does not show-up within Ghidra.

See the Sleigh language documentation (docs/languages/index.html) for details Sleigh language 
specification syntax.
