      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# SuperDllHijack

一种通用Dll劫持技术，不再需要手工导出Dll的函数接口了，so easy！

使用方法：

编写一个和劫持目标Dll同名的dll（如target.dll），原始dll改名为其他名字（如target.dll.1)，在DllMain种调用SuperDllHijack接口完成劫持。

## 更新：

2020年4月4日
1. 修正x64获取peb的bug。感谢[@yves-yl](https://github.com/yves-yl)、[@kiwings](https://github.com/kiwings)、[@6769](https://github.com/6769)。

**更多使用请看`example`代码。**

```
VOID DllHijack1(HMODULE hMod)
{
	TCHAR tszDllPath[MAX_PATH] = { 0 };

	GetModuleFileName(hMod, tszDllPath, MAX_PATH);
	PathRemoveFileSpec(tszDllPath);
	PathAppend(tszDllPath, TEXT("target.dll.1"));

	SuperDllHijack(L"target.dll", tszDllPath);
}

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule,
                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,
                       LPVOID lpReserved
                     )
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
		DllHijack(hModule); break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

# SuperDllHijack

[中文版](./README-zh_CN.md)

A general DLL hijack technology, don't need to manually export the same function interface of the DLL, so easy!


Usage：

Create a DLL with the same name of the hijacked DLL(such as，target.dll), and rename the hijacked DLL to other name(such as, target.dll.1), then call `SuperDllHijack` function to do the hajick work. 


## Update:

2020-4-4
1. fixed the bug of getting peb in x64。Thanks for [@yves-yl](https://github.com/yves-yl)、[@kiwings](https://github.com/kiwings)、[@6769](https://github.com/6769)。

**You can see more details in the `example` code.**

```
VOID DllHijack1(HMODULE hMod)
{
	TCHAR tszDllPath[MAX_PATH] = { 0 };

	GetModuleFileName(hMod, tszDllPath, MAX_PATH);
	PathRemoveFileSpec(tszDllPath);
	PathAppend(tszDllPath, TEXT("target.dll.1"));

	SuperDllHijack(L"target.dll", tszDllPath);
}

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule,
                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,
                       LPVOID lpReserved
                     )
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
		DllHijack(hModule); break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
