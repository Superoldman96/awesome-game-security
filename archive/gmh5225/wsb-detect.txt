# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at me@syscall.party. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

# ⏳ wsb-detect
wsb-detect enables you to detect if you are running in Windows Sandbox ("WSB"). The sandbox is used by Windows Defender for dynamic analysis, and commonly manually by security analysts and alike. At the tail end of 2019, Microsoft introduced a new feature named Windows Sandbox (WSB for short). The techniques used to fingerprint WSB are outlined below, in the techniques section. Feel free to submit a pull request if you have any fingerprinting ideas 🎉. I've been messing around with it now and then, I will have more on Windows Sandbox coming soon.

Windows Sandbox allows you to quickly, within 15s, create a disposable Hyper-V based Virtual Machine with all of the qualities a familiar VM would have such as clipboard sharing, mapping directories etc. The sandbox is also the underlay for Microsoft Defender Application Guard (WDAG), for dynamic analysis on Hyper-V enabled hosts and can be enabled on any Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise machine. It's not particularly interesting, but nonetheless could prove useful in implant development. Thank you to my friend [Jonas L](https://twitter.com/jonasLyk) for guidance when I was exploring the sandbox internals (more to come on this).

# Usage
The `detect.h` header exports all of the functions which can be combined to detect if

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "detect.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  // example vmsmb & username check
  if (wsb_detect_dev() || wsb_detect_username())
  {
    puts("We're in Windows Sandbox!");
    return 0;
  }
  
  return 1;
}
```

# Techniques
### `wsb_detect_proc`
Checks for `CExecSvc.exe`, which is the container execution service, handling a lot of the heavy lifting internally.

### `wsb_detect_time`
The image for the sandbox seems to be built on `Saturday, ‎December ‎7, ‎2019, ‏‎9:14:52 AM` - this is around the time Windows Sandbox was released to the public. This check cross references the creation timestamp on the `mountmgr` driver.

### `wsb_detect_username`
This method will check if the current username is `WDAGUtilityUserAccount`, the account used by default in the sandbox.

### `wsb_detect_suffix`
This method will use `GetAdaptersAddresses`, walk over the list of adapters, and compare the DNS suffix to `mshome.net` - which is used by default in the sandbox.

### `wsb_detect_dev`
Checks if the raw device `\\.\GLOBALROOT\device\vmsmb` can be opened, which is used for communication with the host over SMB.

### `wsb_detect_cmd`
On startup, search under the `RunOnce` key in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` for a command which sets the password never to expire.

### `wsb_detect_genuine`
A more generic method when it comes to sandbox detection, however from tests the Windows doesn't seem to be verified as legitimate in the VMs

# Trivia
If you wish to contact me quicker, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LloydLabs) or [e-mail](mailto:me@syscall.party). Also, it's possible on the host to detect if the sandbox is running, by checking if you can create a mutex named  `WindowsSandboxMutex`. This limits the sandbox to one virtual-machine per host, however, you can release this mutex by simply duplicating the handle and calling `ReleaseMutex` - viola, you can have multiple instances.
