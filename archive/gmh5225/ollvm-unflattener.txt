# ollvm-unflattener

A Python tool to deobfuscate control flow flattening applied by OLLVM (Obfuscator-LLVM). This tool leverages the Miasm framework to analyze and recover the original control flow of functions obfuscated with OLLVM's control flow flattening technique.

## Project Description

OLLVM (Obfuscator-LLVM) is a popular code obfuscation tool that implements various obfuscation techniques, including control flow flattening on the function level. Control flow flattening transforms the original flow of a function into a flat structure using a state variable and a dispatch mechanism, making it difficult to understand the program's logic during the reverse engineering process.

This tool:
- Reconstructs the original control flow of an obfuscated function by identifying and connecting basic blocks
- Generates a deobfuscated binary with the original control flow restored
- Supports multi-layered function deobfuscation by following calls made by the target function using breadth-first search (BFS)

This project is inspired by [MODeflattener](https://github.com/mrT4ntr4/MODeflattener) and the awesome work from [Quarkslab](https://blog.quarkslab.com/deobfuscation-recovering-an-ollvm-protected-program.html)! Unlike **MODeflattener** that solves CFF deobfuscation with a static approach, this project utilitizes Miasm's symbolic execution engine to execute and recover the original control flow. 

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdong1012/ollvm-unflattener.git
cd ollvm-unflattener
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes:
```
miasm
graphviz
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python unflattener -i <input file> -o <output file> -t <target function addresss> -a
```

### Arguments

- `-i, --input`: Path to the obfuscated binary (required)
- `-o, --output`: Path where the deobfuscated binary will be saved (required)
- `-t, --target`: Address of the function to deobfuscate (required)
- `-a, --all`: Follow all calls and deobfuscate all functions we can reach
- `-h, --help`: show help message

### Example

```bash
# Deobfuscate a single function
python unflattener -i ./samples/CFF.bin -o ./samples/deob_CFF.bin -t 0x80491A0

# Deobfuscate 0x8049E00 and follows all of its calls
python unflattener -i ./samples/CFF_full.bin -o ./samples/deob_CFF_full.bin -t 0x8049E00 -a
```

## Results

### Visual Comparison

Below you can see the control flow graph (CFG) before and after deobfuscation:

![Obfuscated CFG](./images/obfuscated.jpg)
*Figure 1: Obfuscated CFG*

![Obfuscated CFG](./images/deobfuscated.jpg)

*Figure 2: Deobfuscated CFG*

These images are from deobfuscating function ```target_function``` from the sample [CFF_full.bin](./samples/CFF_full.bin).

## Limitations
- The tool currently supports x86 only architectures
- I only tested this in x86 Linux binaries. Might need to tweak stuff for Windows PE
