EzApexDMAAimbot
Simple Apex Legends Aimbot with Glow test project using KVM DMA module

Credits:

- 90% aimbot code by TheCruz ported to use with KVM DMA https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/apex-legends/369786-apex-directx-wallhack-smooth-aimbot-source.html

- vmread KVM DMA module by h33p https://github.com/h33p/vmread

Added Features:

- Offsets updated to Apex Legends season 5

- Aimbot has added recoil randomization,non-linear smoothing and target bone randomization to avoid possible serverside detections (Violation-CA thingy)

- By default an additional keyboard is required to be plugged into the linux host as the aimbot activation button is bound to SPACEBAR on linux host, activation using buttons in windows guest is possible, but require updating code and offset in example.cpp to point ADS-ing offset to be read in cheat (note! not sure if this is a detection vector)

- Glow by default has team color differentiation.

How to install:

- install meson and ninja on your linux host
- run "meson builddir" inside vmread folder
- run "ninja" command in builddir to build example.cpp
- run "./example"
```

# Doxyfile 1.8.15

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "vmread"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          =

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path

# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = docs

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES then doxygen will create 4096 sub-
# directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format and
# will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this
# option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of source files, where
# putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise causes
# performance problems for the file system.
# The default value is: NO.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO

# If the ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will allow non-ASCII
# characters to appear in the names of generated files. If set to NO, non-ASCII

# U+3044.
# The default value is: NO.

ALLOW_UNICODE_NAMES    = NO

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language.

OUTPUT_TEXT_DIRECTION  = None

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES, doxygen will include brief member
# descriptions after the members that are listed in the file and class
# documentation (similar to Javadoc). Set to NO to disable this.
# The default value is: YES.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the brief
# description of a member or function before the detailed description

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is
# used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found
# as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text
# and the result, after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated
# text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the

# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = NO

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the full path

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = YES

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        =

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    =

# If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter (but
# less readable) file names. This can be useful is your file systems doesn't
# support long names like on DOS, Mac, or CD-ROM.
# The default value is: NO.

SHORT_NAMES            = NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = NO

# If the QT_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the first
# line (until the first dot) of a Qt-style comment as the brief description. If

# requiring an explicit \brief command for a brief description.)
# The default value is: NO.

QT_AUTOBRIEF           = NO

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make doxygen treat a
# multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// comments) as
# a brief description. This used to be the default behavior. The new default is
# to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed description. Set this
# tag to YES if you prefer the old behavior instead.

# Note that setting this tag to YES also means that rational rose comments are
# not recognized any more.
# The default value is: NO.

MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = NO

# of the file/class/namespace that contains it.
# The default value is: NO.

SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES  = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen

TAB_SIZE               = 4

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in
# the documentation. An alias has the form:
# name=value
# For example adding
# "sideeffect=@par Side Effects:\n"
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the
# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert
# newlines (in the resulting output). You can put ^^ in the value part of an
# alias to insert a newline as if a physical newline was in the original file.
# When you need a literal { or } or , in the value part of an alias you have to
# escape them by means of a backslash (\), this can lead to conflicts with the
# commands \{ and \} for these it is advised to use the version @{ and @} or use
# a double escape (\\{ and \\})

ALIASES                =

# This tag can be used to specify a number of word-keyword mappings (TCL only).
# A mapping has the form "name=value". For example adding "class=itcl::class"
# will allow you to use the command class in the itcl::class meaning.

TCL_SUBST              =

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For

# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = NO

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA tag to YES if your project consists of Java or

# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_SLICE  = NO

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given
# extension. Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it
# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript,
# Csharp (C#), C, C++, D, PHP, md (Markdown), Objective-C, Python, Slice,
# Fortran (fixed format Fortran: FortranFixed, free formatted Fortran:
# FortranFree, unknown formatted Fortran: Fortran. In the later case the parser
# tries to guess whether the code is fixed or free formatted code, this is the
# default for Fortran type files), VHDL, tcl. For instance to make doxygen treat
# .inc files as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C (default is
# Fortran), use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note: For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.
#
# Note that for custom extensions you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise
# the files are not read by doxygen.

# If the MARKDOWN_SUPPORT tag is enabled then doxygen pre-processes all comments
# according to the Markdown format, which allows for more readable
# documentation. See https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ for details.
# The output of markdown processing is further processed by doxygen, so you can
# mix doxygen, HTML, and XML commands with Markdown formatting. Disable only in

TOC_INCLUDE_HEADINGS   = 0

# When enabled doxygen tries to link words that correspond to documented
# classes, or namespaces to their corresponding documentation. Such a link can

AUTOLINK_SUPPORT       = YES

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and

CPP_CLI_SUPPORT        = NO

# Set the SIP_SUPPORT tag to YES if your project consists of sip (see:
# https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/intro) sources only. Doxygen

# of private inheritance when no explicit protection keyword is present.
# The default value is: NO.

SIP_SUPPORT            = NO

# For Microsoft's IDL there are propget and propput attributes to indicate
# getter and setter methods for a property. Setting this option to YES will make
# doxygen to replace the get and set methods by a property in the documentation.
# This will only work if the methods are indeed getting or setting a simple
# type. If this is not the case, or you want to show the methods anyway, you
# should set this option to NO.
# The default value is: YES.

IDL_PROPERTY_SUPPORT   = YES

# If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC
# tag is set to YES then doxygen will reuse the documentation of the first

GROUP_NESTED_COMPOUNDS = NO

# Set the SUBGROUPING tag to YES to allow class member groups of the same type
# (for instance a group of public functions) to be put as a subgroup of that
# type (e.g. under the Public Functions section). Set it to NO to prevent

# to NO, structs, classes, and unions are shown on a separate page (for HTML and
# Man pages) or section (for LaTeX and RTF).
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_SIMPLE_STRUCTS  = NO

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT tag is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or
# enum is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So
# typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct
# with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file,
# namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically be
# useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound
# types are typedef'ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name.
# The default value is: NO.

TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT   = NO

# The size of the symbol lookup cache can be set using LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE. This
# cache is used to resolve symbols given their name and scope. Since this can be
# an expensive process and often the same symbol appears multiple times in the
# code, doxygen keeps a cache of pre-resolved symbols. If the cache is too small
# doxygen will become slower. If the cache is too large, memory is wasted. The
# cache size is given by this formula: 2^(16+LOOKUP_CACHE_SIZE). The valid range
# is 0..9, the default is 0, corresponding to a cache size of 2^16=65536
# symbols. At the end of a run doxygen will report the cache usage and suggest

# A library to read/write memory to Windows running inside of KVM

wintools.h and mem.h provide most of the functions callable to interract with the Windows VM, while hlapi abstracts everything in a bit simpler to use manner (requires C++).

Rust bindings are available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Heep042/vmread-rs).

##### Compiling
Minimum language standard: C99
The current example project is in C++, requiring at least C++11 with template support, but the C version also exists, which works fine on a C99 compiler.

Use meson and ninja to compile the example programs

Use make to compile the kernel module

##### Performance
Internal (QEMU inject) mode is roughly 7 times faster than external mode. However, it is possible to use the kernel module to map the memory space of QEMU into the external process, mitigating the performance penalty. Also, when performing larger reads, the memcpy quickly reaches its peak speed and external mode begins to catch up. Performance numbers are shown below.

![alt text](https://github.com/Heep042/vmread/raw/master/rwperf.png "Read performance")


##### Frequent issues
Make sure to use the Q35 chipset on the KVM guest, unless it is running Windows XP. Otherwise, the library may not work correctly.
Kmod mapping is not guaranteed to work properly or for extended periods of time if the VM is not set up to use hugepages.

##### Licensing note
While most of the codebase is under the MIT license, the kernel module (kmem.c file) is licensed under GNU GPLv2.
