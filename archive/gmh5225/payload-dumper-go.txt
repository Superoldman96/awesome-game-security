# payload-dumper-go

An android OTA payload dumper written in Go.

## Features

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/IJtwoWU.png)

See how fast payload-dumper-go is: https://imgur.com/a/X6HKJT4. (MacBook Pro 16-inch 2019 i9-9750H, 16G)

- Incredibly fast decompression. All decompression progresses are executed in parallel.
- Payload checksum verification.
- Support original zip package that contains payload.bin.

### Cautions

- Working on a SSD is highly recommended for performance reasons, a HDD could be a bottle-neck.

### Limitations

- Incremental OTA (delta) payload is not supported.

## Installation

0. Download the latest binary for your platform from [here](https://github.com/ssut/payload-dumper-go/releases) and extract the contents of the downloaded file to a directory on your system.

### Linux and OSX

1. Make sure the extracted binary file has executable permissions. You can use the following command to set the permissions if necessary:
```
chmod +x payload-dumper-go
```
2. Run the following command to add the directory path to your system's PATH environment variable:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/payload-dumper-go
```
Note: This command sets the PATH environment variable only for the current terminal session. To make it permanent, you need to add the command to your system's profile file (e.g. .bashrc or .zshrc for Linux/Unix systems).

### Windows

1. Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".
2. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
3. Click on the "Environment Variables" button at the bottom right corner of the "System Properties" window.
4. Under "System Variables", scroll down and click on the "Path" variable, then click on "Edit".
5. Click "New" and add the path to the directory where the extracted binary is located.
6. Click "OK" on all the windows to save the changes.

## Usage

Run the following command in your terminal:
```
payload-dumper-go /path/to/payload.bin
```

//
// Update file format: An update file contains all the operations needed
// to update a system to a specific version. It can be a full payload which
// can update from any version, or a delta payload which can only update
// from a specific version.
// The update format is represented by this struct pseudocode:
// struct delta_update_file {
//   char magic[4] = "CrAU";
//   uint64 file_format_version;  // payload major version
//   uint64 manifest_size;  // Size of protobuf DeltaArchiveManifest
//
//   // Only present if format_version >= 2:
//   uint32 metadata_signature_size;
//
//   // The DeltaArchiveManifest protobuf serialized, not compressed.
//   char manifest[manifest_size];
//
//   // The signature of the metadata (from the beginning of the payload up to
//   // this location, not including the signature itself). This is a serialized
//   // Signatures message.
//   char metadata_signature_message[metadata_signature_size];
//
//   // Data blobs for files, no specific format. The specific offset
//   // and length of each data blob is recorded in the DeltaArchiveManifest.
//   struct {
//     char data[];
//   } blobs[];
//
//   // The signature of the entire payload, everything up to this location,
//   // except that metadata_signature_message is skipped to simplify signing
//   // process. These two are not signed:
//   uint64 payload_signatures_message_size;
//   // This is a serialized Signatures message.
//   char payload_signatures_message[payload_signatures_message_size];
//
// };
// The DeltaArchiveManifest protobuf is an ordered list of InstallOperation
// objects. These objects are stored in a linear array in the
// DeltaArchiveManifest. Each operation is applied in order by the client.
// The DeltaArchiveManifest also contains the initial and final
// checksums for the device.
// The client will perform each InstallOperation in order, beginning even
// before the entire delta file is downloaded (but after at least the
// protobuf is downloaded). The types of operations are explained:
// - REPLACE: Replace the dst_extents on the drive with the attached data,
//   zero padding out to block size.
// - REPLACE_BZ: bzip2-uncompress the attached data and write it into
//   dst_extents on the drive, zero padding to block size.
// - MOVE: Copy the data in src_extents to dst_extents. Extents may overlap,
//   so it may be desirable to read all src_extents data into memory before
//   writing it out. (deprecated)
// - SOURCE_COPY: Copy the data in src_extents in the old partition to
//   dst_extents in the new partition. There's no overlapping of data because
//   the extents are in different partitions.
// - BSDIFF: Read src_length bytes from src_extents into memory, perform
//   bspatch with attached data, write new data to dst_extents, zero padding
//   to block size. (deprecated)
// - SOURCE_BSDIFF: Read the data in src_extents in the old partition, perform
//   bspatch with the attached data and write the new data to dst_extents in the
//   new partition.
// - ZERO: Write zeros to the destination dst_extents.
// - DISCARD: Discard the destination dst_extents blocks on the physical medium.
//   the data read from those blocks is undefined.
// - REPLACE_XZ: Replace the dst_extents with the contents of the attached
//   xz file after decompression. The xz file should only use crc32 or no crc at
//   all to be compatible with xz-embedded.
// - PUFFDIFF: Read the data in src_extents in the old partition, perform
//   puffpatch with the attached data and write the new data to dst_extents in
//   the new partition.
//
// The operations allowed in the payload (supported by the client) depend on the
// major and minor version. See InstallOperation.Type below for details.

// Update file format: An update file contains all the operations needed

// struct delta_update_file {
//   char magic[4] = "CrAU";

// The DeltaArchiveManifest protobuf is an ordered list of InstallOperation
// objects. These objects are stored in a linear array in the
// DeltaArchiveManifest. Each operation is applied in order by the client.
// The DeltaArchiveManifest also contains the initial and final
// checksums for the device.
// The client will perform each InstallOperation in order, beginning even
// before the entire delta file is downloaded (but after at least the
// protobuf is downloaded). The types of operations are explained:
// - REPLACE: Replace the dst_extents on the drive with the attached data,
//   zero padding out to block size.
// - REPLACE_BZ: bzip2-uncompress the attached data and write it into
//   dst_extents on the drive, zero padding to block size.
// - MOVE: Copy the data in src_extents to dst_extents. Extents may overlap,
//   so it may be desirable to read all src_extents data into memory before
//   writing it out. (deprecated)
// - SOURCE_COPY: Copy the data in src_extents in the old partition to
//   dst_extents in the new partition. There's no overlapping of data because
//   the extents are in different partitions.
// - BSDIFF: Read src_length bytes from src_extents into memory, perform
//   bspatch with attached data, write new data to dst_extents, zero padding
//   to block size. (deprecated)
// - SOURCE_BSDIFF: Read the data in src_extents in the old partition, perform
//   bspatch with the attached data and write the new data to dst_extents in the
//   new partition.
// - ZERO: Write zeros to the destination dst_extents.
// - DISCARD: Discard the destination dst_extents blocks on the physical medium.
//   the data read from those blocks is undefined.
// - REPLACE_XZ: Replace the dst_extents with the contents of the attached
//   xz file after decompression. The xz file should only use crc32 or no crc at
//   all to be compatible with xz-embedded.
// - PUFFDIFF: Read the data in src_extents in the old partition, perform
//   puffpatch with the attached data and write the new data to dst_extents in
//   the new partition.
//
// The operations allowed in the payload (supported by the client) depend on the
// major and minor version. See InstallOperation.Type below for details.
