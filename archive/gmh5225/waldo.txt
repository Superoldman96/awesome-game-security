2. License Grants and Conditions

---

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

---

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

---

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

---

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

```md
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

```md
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

                We&apos;re starting small, and will only support a few games at
                launch. As we develop Waldo Vision, we hope to add support for a

## Customize This Theme

### Site metadata

`src/config.ts` contains several data objects that describe metadata about your site like title, description, default language, and Open Graph details. You can customize these to match your project.

### CSS styling

The theme's look and feel is controlled by a few key variables that you can customize yourself. You'll find them in the `src/styles/theme.css` CSS file.

If you've never worked with CSS variables before, give [MDN's guide on CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) a quick read.

This theme uses a "cool blue" accent color by default. To customize this for your project, change the `--theme-accent` variable to whatever color you'd like:

```diff
/* src/styles/theme.css */
:root {
  color-scheme: light;
-  --theme-accent: hsla(var(--color-blue), 1);
+  --theme-accent: hsla(var(--color-red), 1);   /* or: hsla(#FF0000, 1); */
```

## Page metadata

Astro uses frontmatter in Markdown pages to choose layouts and pass properties to those layouts. If you are using the default layout, you can customize the page in many different ways to optimize SEO and other things. For example, you can use the `title` and `description` properties to set the document title, meta title, meta description, and Open Graph description.

```markdown
---
title: Example title
description: Really cool docs example that uses Astro
layout: ../../layouts/MainLayout.astro
---

# Page content...
```

For more SEO related properties, look at `src/components/HeadSEO.astro`

### Sidebar navigation

The sidebar navigation is controlled by the `SIDEBAR` variable in your `src/config.ts` file. You can customize the sidebar by modifying this object. A default, starter navigation has already been created for you.

```ts
export const SIDEBAR = {
  en: [
    { text: "Section Header", header: true },
    { text: "Introduction", link: "en/introduction" },
    { text: "Page 2", link: "en/page-2" },
    { text: "Page 3", link: "en/page-3" },

    { text: "Another Section", header: true },
    { text: "Page 4", link: "en/page-4" },
  ],
};
```

Note the top-level `en` key: This is needed for multi-language support. You can change it to whatever language you'd like, or add new languages as you go. More details on this below.

### Multiple Languages support

The Astro docs template supports multiple langauges out of the box. The default theme only shows `en` documentation, but you can enable multi-language support features by adding a second language to your project.

To add a new language to your project, you'll want to extend the current `src/pages/[lang]/...` layout:

```diff
 📂 src/pages
 ┣ 📂 en
 ┃ ┣ 📜 page-1.md
 ┃ ┣ 📜 page-2.md
 ┃ ┣ 📜 page-3.astro
+ ┣ 📂 es
+ ┃ ┣ 📜 page-1.md
+ ┃ ┣ 📜 page-2.md
+ ┃ ┣ 📜 page-3.astro
```

You'll also need to add the new language name to the `KNOWN_LANGUAGES` map in your `src/config.ts` file. This will enable your new language switcher in the site header.

```diff
// src/config.ts
export const KNOWN_LANGUAGES = {
  English: 'en',
+  Spanish: 'es',
};
```

Last step: you'll need to add a new entry to your sidebar, to create the table of contents for that language. While duplicating every page might not sound ideal to everyone, this extra control allows you to create entirely custom content for every language.

> Make sure the sidebar `link` value points to the correct language!

```diff
// src/config.ts
export const SIDEBAR = {
  en: [
    { text: 'Section Header', header: true, },
    { text: 'Introduction', link: 'en/introduction' },
    // ...
  ],
+  es: [
+    { text: 'Encabezado de sección', header: true, },
+    { text: 'Introducción', link: 'es/introduction' },
+    // ...
+  ],
};

// ...
```

If you plan to use Spanish as the the default language, you just need to modify the redirect path in `src/pages/index.astro`:

```diff
<script>
- window.location.pathname = `/en/introduction`;
+ window.location.pathname = `/es/introduction`;
</script>
```

You can also remove the above script and write a landing page in Spanish instead.

### What if I don't plan to support multiple languages?

That's totally fine! Not all projects need (or can support) multiple languages. You can continue to use this theme without ever adding a second language.

If that single language is not English, you can just replace `en` in directory layouts and configurations with the preferred language.

### Search (Powered by Algolia)

[Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) offers a free service to qualified open source projects called [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/). If you are accepted to the DocSearch program, provide your API Key & index name in `src/config.ts` and a search box will automatically appear in your site header.

Note that Aglolia and Astro are not affiliated. We have no say over acceptance to the DocSearch program.

If you'd prefer to remove Algolia's search and replace it with your own, check out the `src/components/Header.astro` component to see where the component is added.

layout: ../../layouts/MainLayout.astro
---

## Are you affiliated with Anybrain?

No. We're completely separate and Basically Homeless wasn't paid to endorse them.

## Can I support financially?

No. As we're still in a relatively early phase of the project, and aren't promising any specific results, we don't feel that it would be right to take any money.

## How can I help?

Help us by submitting or reviewing gameplay clips on the waldo.vision website. We also have Analysis and Infrastructure teams that need volunteers if you have some technical skills and want to help develop the project.

## How will WALDO work?

We will train ML models on a combination of labeled and unlabeled gameplay videos to train it to detect aimbot cheating. We will be working on a more detailed whitepaper in the future.

## What is the scope of WALDO?

Right now we are focused on detecting aimbots (humanized aimbots, specifically) in FPS gameplay videos. If all goes well, we hope to expand to different forms of cheating.

## The website will only let me submit gameplay for a few videos. Will you add more games in the future?

Yes, we will expand this list of games in the near future.

## Is this an anti-cheat?

No, Waldo will analyse video footage to detect aimbot cheating. No action will come directly from Waldo.

## What kind of gameplay should I submit? Does it need to be in any special format?

Record a normal round of gameplay with whatever capture method you typically use. It doesn't need to be in any particular format, but nothing longer than 30 minutes please. Imagine you're recording a gameplay video that you're going to edit into a montage later on 😎. You'll then upload it to YouTube, and submit the link to the video on the waldo.vision submissions page.

title: Getting Started
description: Getting started with contributing to Waldo Vision
layout: ../../layouts/MainLayout.astro
---

## Prerequisites

Before you can start hacking away on waldo, you need to have the tools below to ensure everything works.

- Node.js - The current `LTS` version
- Rust - So our desktop app can build
- Yarn - Our package manager of choice

## Deploying Services

Waldo Vision is dependent on a number of services, and depending on your needs, you can either self host, or use a cloud option for all of them. We recommend you self host for ease of development, but the cloud options do exist if you wish to use them.

### Cloud Options

#### CockroachDB

If you don't wish to self host CockroachDB for development, we advise you use CockroachDB's free [serverless tier](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-started-cockroachdb/) during development.

### Self Hosting

If you feel comfortable self hosting, for our use case, you we require that you additionally install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Docker is used to help ensure that the services are setup consistantly setup accross all our contributors' machines. (If you want to use podman instead of docker, you can, but we will not provide assistance with it.)

To start the services locally, simply run `docker compose up -d`. Or shut them off with `docker compose down`. (Run these in the repo after you have cloned it.)

- Option for Windows Users:
  - <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">WARNING: Not recommended for development, use at your own risk, no support provided</span>.
  - For Windows you can download the Beta Archive from [Cockroachlabs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb-windows.html)
    and run the exe with `./cockroach.exe start-single-node --insecure`
  - Then set the `DATABASE_URL` variable in `/packages/database/.env` and `/packages/web/.env` to the url displayed on start for postgresql
  - You even have a Web interface for management and debugging
  - WARNING BETA: (From their site: The CockroachDB executable for Windows is experimental and not suitable for production deployments. Windows 8 or higher is required.)

## Setting Up Code

1. Clone the git repo `https://github.com/waldo-vision/waldo` to your machine then navigate to it using the 'cd' console command.
1. Run `yarn install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
1. To setup our ORM, run `yarn turbo db:generate`.
1. Now, you need to choose whether you want to login with Discord, or Github.
   - If you choose Github, follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app). Be sure to set the `Callback URL` to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`.
   - If you choose Discord, follow [this guide](https://discordjs.guide/oauth2/#getting-an-oauth2-url) until you have added the `Redirect URL`. Be sure to set this to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord`.
1. Copy `apps/web/.env.example` and rename said copy to `apps/web/.env`.

   - Take the `client id` and `client secret` from the above to fill in the fields in the .env file like so:

   ```.env
    DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="57324592435671234019234"
    DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="342759ASDa82dsaf345-ADHFUFA"

    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="7482521243341245243"
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="FDGNJO3490TNGFMGDSK"
   ```

1. To connect to the database, in the `.env` file set the `DATABASE_URL` like below:

   ```.env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable"
   ```

   (This is if you're self hosting, if you're using CockroachDB cloud, copy the connection URL from the dashboard.)

1. Run `yarn turbo run db:push` to setup the database for the website.

1. Additionally, you may also want to set the `Cloudflare Turnstile` keys so that submissions work, or the `Youtube API Key` so that the review site works properly.

   - Currently there is no guide for these items, but there isn't much to setting them up. The only item of note is that the YT API Key needs to be `version 3` of the api.
   - If you do not wish to setup a cloudflare site to be able to generate turnstile keys, you can use the demo site and secret keys which you can find here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/frequently-asked-questions/#are-there-sitekeys-and-secret-keys-that-can-be-used-for-testing.

1. The finale `.env` file _might_ look a little something like this after everything is filled in:

   ```.env
    DISCORD_CLIENT_ID="57324592435671234019234"
    DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET="342759ASDa82dsaf345-ADHFUFA"

    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="7482521243341245243"
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="FDGNJO3490TNGFMGDSK"

    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable"

    # plus some other stuff if you set it
   ```

1. There is additional `.env` file in `packages/database`. The database url should be the same as above.

   ```.env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://root@localhost:26257?sslmode=disable"
   ```

## Actually running code

- The Project uses [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/workspace), which are defined in `/package.json`
- Each submodule (database/webfrontend/webbackend/desktop app) defines its own `package.json` which is then used by yarn to run commands on it
- For example running the webfrontend can be done with: `yarn workspace web start`
- Usually it spins up a webserver at some localhost port, which is displayed in the command line
- Additional info about the monorepo can be found at [Working in the monorepo](/en/working-in-monorepo)

## Picking work

Just some advice for working in the [Waldo Vision monorepo](https://github.com/waldo-vision/waldo).

## Project Structure

Inside the `apps` directory are all the Waldo Vision "apps". This includes this website (the docs), the main Waldo Vision website, and the desktop app.

Inside the `packages` directory is code that is reused between many of the different apps. You can consider these packages to be shared utilities if it helps you conceptualize it.

## Breaking Change Guide

If your pull request contains a breaking change you must specify what the breaking change is and add it to the changelog for the current version.

## Useful Commands

### Turbo

With [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference), the command `turbo run` allows you to run the same command in every workspace.

Say you wanted to build everything, you just need to run `turbo run build`, and every workspace will begin to build in the correct order.
You could also for example lint everything with `turbo run lint`.

You should note that unless you have turbo installed globally, you will need to do `yarn turbo` instead of just `turbo`.

### Yarn Workspaces

With [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/workspace), you are able to run commands in a specific workspaces.

For example, you can add react to the website with `yarn workspace web add react`, or build it alone with `yarn workspace web build`.

## What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

## Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?

**_If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you._**

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

- **Consent.** We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click [here](#withdrawing-your-consent) to learn more.

- **Performance of a Contract.** We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.

- **Legitimate Interests.** We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:

  1. Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users

  2. Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities

- **Legal Obligations.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
- **Vital Interests.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

**_If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you._**

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click [here](#withdrawing-your-consent) to learn more.

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:

- If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
- For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
- For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
- If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
- For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
- If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
- If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
- If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
- If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

## 4. When and with whom do we share your personal information?

## 5. Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?

**_In Short:_** _We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information._

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice: https://docs.waldo.vision/legal/cookie-policy/.

## 6. How do we handle your social logins?

**_In Short:_** _If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you._

Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.

We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

## 7. How long do we keep your information?

**_In Short:_** _We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law._

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 8. How do we keep your information safe?

**_In Short:_** _We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures._

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## 9. Do we collect information from minors?

**_In Short:_** _We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age._

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at contact@waldo.vision.

## 10. What are your privacy rights?

**_In Short:_** _In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time._

If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.

##### Withdrawing your consent:

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section ["How can you contact us about this notice?"](#14-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice) below or updating your preferences.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. To opt out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. For further information, please see our Cookie Notice: https://docs.waldo.vision/legal/cookie-policy/.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at contact@waldo.vision.

## 11. Controls for DO-NOT-TRACK features?

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

## 12. Do California residents have specific privacy rights?

**_In Short:_** _Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information._

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California.

## 17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Informal Negotiations

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

Binding Arbitration

If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website: www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Potter County, Texas. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Potter County, Texas, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use.

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

Restrictions

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

## 18. CORRECTIONS

There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.
