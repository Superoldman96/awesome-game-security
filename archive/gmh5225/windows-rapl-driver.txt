      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Windows driver for RAPL metrics gathering

## Installation (for testing/troubleshooting purposes, in test mode)

### Enable test mode

For now, the driver is unsigned, so you need to put windows in test mode (allowing custom drivers to run).

To do this, open a command prompt **as an administrator** and run :

	bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON
	
Then restart the computer or server.

Once restarted, if on a desktop, you should have some text written on the bottom right corner of the desktop view with **"Test Mode"** displayed.

To disable test mode just open another command prompt with adminstrator access and run :

	bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING OFF

### Installing the driver

First download or [compile](#Compilation) :
- DriverLoader.exe
- ScaphandreDrv.sys

You need those files in the same folder.

Then run, in an adminstrator command prompt :

	DriverLoader.exe install

At any time you could check for the state of the service giving access to the driver on your system, with this command :

	driverquery /v | grep -i scaph
	
If running properly it should show a line like :

	Scaphandre Dr Scaphandre Driver Serv Scaphandre Driver Serv File System    System            Running    OK         TRUE             FALSE                  0                 4□096       0          14/01/2022 16:01:37    C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\ScaphandreDrv.sys    4□096

	
## Compilation
	
TODO

## Context

This driver has been developped for a specific use case : enabling [Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre) on Windows.

Please have a look at [those slides](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre/files/8601923/Boavizta.-.Scaphandre_RAPL_Windows.pdf) for a better understanding of how and why this driver has been developped.

## Cross compilation MinGW (OUTDATED)

Dependencies:
- x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++

Compilation:
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ DriverLoader.cpp -o DriverLoader.exe

## Compilation CPUID (OUTDATED)

Code getting CPU manufacturer's informations (through CPUID) uses inlined assembly.

To compile on Linux, we need to tell GCC to use the Intel syntax and not the At&T one. We also need to specify we don't want an axecutable with independant position.

Example : gcc -masm=intel -no-pie cpuid.c -o cpuid

To compile on Windows, we can inline 32 bit assembly but not 64 bit (MSVC compiler doesn't support it).

To fix this, the __cpuid__ function is written in pure assembly matching the Windows ABI (x86 and x86_64). To compile, use those commands :
 - x86 : nasm -f win32 cpuid_x86.nasm -o cpuid_x86.obj
 - x86_64 : nasm -f win64 cpuid_x86_64.nasm -o cpuid_x86_64.obj

To compile the agent, including the __cpuid__ function, do it according to the architecture :
 - x86_64 : x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ RAPLAgent.cpp -s cpuid_x86_64.obj -o RAPLAgent.exe
