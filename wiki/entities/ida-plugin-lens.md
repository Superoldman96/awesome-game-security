# Plugin Lens

**Plugin Lens** (AlonSoko) is a Python **IDA Pro** GUI plugin (**IDA 9.0+**) that reorganizes **Edit › Plugins** for reverse engineers, malware analysts, and game-security researchers who rely on large **hcli** and **ida-plugin.json** plugin stacks.

## Capabilities

- **Icons:** from each plugin’s `ida-plugin.json` logo, bundled artwork for built-in entries, or custom images in the user `plugin-lens` folder—without overwriting icons a plugin already sets.
- **Grouping:** built-in plugins, hcli-installed plugins (by repository), and manually installed plugins.
- **Version visibility:** superscript version numbers and tags when hcli reports newer releases.
- **Updates:** a menu action runs hcli’s upgrade flow inside IDA for selected plugins.

Workflow infrastructure—not decompilation or automation. Complements [[ida-settings]] configuration management and [[ida-plugin-repository]] manifest discovery.
